1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Residual Life 1.9 (Half-Life mod) to sven coop.
i aim to keep most of the content of the original mod. You are free to report bugs or 
suggest changes if you want but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do 
this as a hobby and for the challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server 
owners. About bugs i did plenty of singleplayer testing but this mappack is huge and
issues may slip past me.    

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Important Notes 
You can play all the paths on dedicated servers. On listenservers paths are limited and
a few maps are skipped to avoid problems with env_global. This is supposed to be fixed 
in the next SC version(5.23). Check dedicated_paths.text and listen_paths.text to have 
a better idea of which paths you can take. In a dedicated server try not to skip maps,
that can lead to break stuff.

3. Changes made from the original mod
You can pick the desert eagle in a secret area. This weapon was not implemented in the
original mod but i added it anyway. 
Get the secrets on the first time on a map or you will be locked of doing it later.
To get the second cell area you need to get the first one and find the first 2 secrets.
To enter the talisman area you need to obtain the gravity gun.
The Sun eater Pillar chapter have some simplified paths to avoid going forward and back
too much times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues 
A few npc sentences does not play i am trying to understand why this is happening.
The zombie grunts does not have the right sounds: Somewhen i will take a deep breath 
and deal with that.
