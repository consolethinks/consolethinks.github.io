Here are the wavs for the scientist that I completed.
I will try to go over the 4 previous to shl_ship to see
if i can record them better. They do sound a bit staticky, but ill see if i can improve upon it. I tried to put a little variety in the scientists speech patterns, for not all of the scientists should sound the same ;). Tell me what you think!

shl_ship - A scientist's sentence
(A little hasty tone)

This is the gray alien's mothership.
They plan to conquer Earth while we are still weakened by the war with 
the Xen aliens!
You must stop them!
Find your way through the ship.
You may find some other humans they have captured.
If you rescue them, they are sure to help you defeat the aliens.
Destroy the mothership, or kill the captain, and they will not be able to 
win.
