1 - Introduction

===================================================

Welcome to Sweet Half-Life, a single player modification for Half-Life in the tradition of "Opposing Force" and "Blue Shift". Sweet Half-Life presents a 'side-story' of Half-Life, where the events of Half-Life are slightly altered. It consists of a series of maps which present the story as the player progresses, eventually offering two routes (and two endings) to choose from. The mod includes several new enemies, allies and weapons which the player encounters along the way. 

 ===========================
 1.1 - Story
 ===========================

In this MOD, you assume the role of warehouse manager Gordon McGinley who becomes involved in the Black Mesa accident.  This MOD features new weapons, new enemies and new allies. Also, the player will meet a new character, a mysterious woman.  Who is this woman, and how is she connected to the events surrounding Black Mesa?

2 - Getting started

===================================================

This mod is installed and used in the same way as any other. If you do not know how a Half-Life mod is installed, follow the instructions below.


 ===========================
 2.1 - Important information
 ===========================

First of all, if you installed the HD pack (high definition pack which was included with Blue Shift,) then DO
NOT RUN THIS MOD.  The game will freeze.  If you want to play this game, then you must uninstall your HD pack!!!

Somewhere along the level, you will be given a choice to make.  This choice will affect the outcome of the game.  That is to say, this level pack has multiple endings, so be sure to play through twice to see both endings! If you can't spot the point where the routes diverge, check the help file. Also, hang around for a while once you finish as the ending cinematics are quite extensive.

Half-Life 1.0.1.6 is required. However we recommend that you get the latest version of Half-Life.

 ===========================
 2.2 - Installation
 ===========================

First, you need to find your Half-Life directory. By default this is found in C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\, unless you chose another location to install to. Next, you need to extract the files from the zip file; the files will extract into a new subdirectory of Half-Life, called 'SHL'. And that's the installation complete!

 ===========================
 2.3 - Starting a game
 ===========================

Mods are launched using the 'Custom game' browser. Start Half-Life as normal, and click on 'Custom game'. You will be presented with a list of all the mods on your computer, including 'Sweet Half-Life'. Scroll down the list and choose the mod called 'Sweet Half-Life' then click on activate. The background will change to Sweet Half-Life's title screen. Click on 'Done' then 'New game' to start a game or 'Load game' to load a previously saved game.

 ===========================
 2.4 - Stuck in the game?
 ===========================

There are several areas in Sweet Half-Life that may not be obvious at first glance. Try searching for a route or button that was previously unavailable or which you haven't used yet. Failing that, try the basic guide in the 'SHL' directory, go to either of the Sweet Half-Life homepages for help, or contact one of the team (see below).

 ===========================
 2.5 - Troubleshooting
 ===========================

Q - The mod doesn't show up on the 'Custom game' screen!
A - Check that all the files have been extracted to the mod's directory under Half-Life. The 'SHL' directory should be about 75MB in size. If you find files are missing, extract them from the zip again. Another problem could be that there is no disk space left and the files cannot be extracted!

Q - My game crashes / the player gets jammed. Help!
A - We've been fairly thorough in bug-hunting, but that doesn't mean that the game is foolproof. Check the website first, in case a patch is already available. If you think you've found a new bug, send a bug report to Gareth Lough (see below for contact details), detailing how to produce the fault and what problem is caused.

 ===========================
 2.6 - Uninstalling
 ===========================

Should you wish to remove this excellent mod for some reason, just delete the 'SHL' folder found in your 'Half-Life' folder.
