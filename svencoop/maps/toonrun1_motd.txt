MISSION OBJECIVE

The Slimy-Sweaty-Evil-Giant-Mega-Monster-Boss-From-Outer-Space
(called The Mother Spleen[tm]) has built an Evil Giant Cloning
Killing machine. Originally you wanted to make holidays next to
the domain of the Slimy-Sweaty-Evil-Giant-Mega-Monster-Boss (The
travel brochure praised its healthy green environment), but now
it looks as if your fighting skill is needed. Just by coincidence
you are also a member of a local Marvel-Super-Heroes club, so you
and your heroic friends feel obligated to go on a suicide trip
into the fortress of the Slimy-Sweaty-Evil-Giant-Mega-Monster-Boss
From-Outer-Space to turn off the Evil Giant Cloning Killing machine,
to destroy the Slimy-Sweaty-Evil-Giant-Mega-Monster-Boss, to
defend the rights of humanity, to get away from your annoying
wives and to avert all the rest of the usual Armageddon stuff.
