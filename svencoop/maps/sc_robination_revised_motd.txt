Sven Co-op: Robination (maps/sc_robination_revised.bsp)
by
Silencer

Players: 2 - 8 (Ideally 4)

In the chaos of the battle against zombies you lose your way and are now stuck up in some underground sewer.
Survive the madness!

Hints:
- You only have one life, but there are checkpoints which respawn everyone.
- Items that do not respawn have a glowing shell.
- Ledge-climbing is disabled.
- It is sometimes better to avoid enemies than to try and kill all of them.
- Value your armor. It is very durable against all sorts of attacks.
- The 9mm handgun and the crowbar actually pack a punch.
- Are you an experienced player? Then try to find the special collectibles! They will be of use in the sequel.
