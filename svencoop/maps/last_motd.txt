The year is 4052, Earth was blown out ages ago.
A fatal meteorcrash started a nuclear winter, which
wiped out most of the human race. The survivors 
were forced to find a new planet suitable for 
living. Thanks to Wormhole-Technology the survivors
found an Earth-like Planet : New Hope.
New Hope seemed like a new future for the human
race, until the first attacks started. An unknown 
alien race, named Argressians, attacked the new
founded settlements. There was no defense at all. 
Again forced, the humans picked up their weapon
production and fought back, but the Agressians
outnumbered the humans with their waygates.

The humans founded a special team of Elite Fighters.
These fighters should be able to find the source
of the waygates and shut them down, forever.

You are one of those Elite Fighters.
