There's a chance Jesus 2 will get stuck on his raft. Crowbar or use him to get the raft moving again.

When using the plane, stay in the cockpit until the long straightaway. Then, jump up so your back hits the tail rudder. At that point you can move around on the tail to get in a better position to fall through the hoops.

Both hoops have to be fallen through at the same time (requires 2 player) to trigger the next sequence.
