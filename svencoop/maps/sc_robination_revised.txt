Important notice: The sounds listed above have been edited, e.g.
cut and given an earlier fade-out, resampled at lower sample
rates and saved as mono, partially at a lower bit-rate, in order
to give them a lower filesize and have them work with the game's
sound engine properly. Do not judge the original sounds by the
edited versions which shipped with this map. Follow the provided
links above to listen to the original samples of some of the sounds.
Many thanks to freesound.org!

The dead tree models were found at http://models.cs-mapping.com.ua/main.php.

Unfortunately, no mention of the models' authors are to be found there.
However, at this point, I'd like to thank the authors of the models very much.
Thank you!
