                        : There's a bunch of really crazy bugs that no one's going to notice, and if you notice them, I declare you a silly goose.

			: The Sven Co-op fans who stuck with the mod for so long, even if it meant turning every single server into xp mod monstrosities ;) I'm sure this mod will live on for at least another 4 years.
