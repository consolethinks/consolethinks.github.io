-----------------------------------

You exterminated the creature which appeared to be the leader of the
alien pack in Crystal. After entering a portal that emerged from the
alien you find yourself in a distant world, a place like you have never
seen before.

This could very well be the aliens' home world and it gives us a 
chance to put an end to this invasion once and for all. There is no telling
what danger awaits you ahead so keep your head cool and proceed
with caution.

Team, it's do or die time now. Let's do it!
