* Construction *

Editor(s)		: Valve Hammer Editor 3.5
Build Time		: Originally created during the 3.5 beta test in 1-2 months, which I released a few days after 4.0 came out. Then another 1-2 months spent creating this much improved version.
Build Machine		: Do you honestly, really care?
Compile Time		: Not long.
Known Bugs		: If a new wave starts while a babygarg is flaming, strange things will happen.
			: The mode selection system sometimes gets a little glitchy. Appears to depend on server lag.
                      
R_speeds                : Decent

Tips                	: Use teamwork!

Other stuff             : For more fun and shenanigans, check out some of my other maps: Abandoned, Jumpers, Rickshaw, Underground and Overrun.
			: This map contains no secrets. Absolutely no secrets. Don't go looking for any, because you won't find them.	
			: If you have questions or comments about the map, send me an email.

                        : AdamR and Jolene for hosting test servers.
			: A1win, for editing the Tor and Alien Grunt models because I was too lazy to find a decompiler. I eventually had to find it anyway to edit the other models, so I probably wasted your time. HAH.
