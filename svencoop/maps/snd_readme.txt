         A Sven Co-op map by Hezus

This map started out when I wanted to revamp Sandstone in early 2020. I had already upgraded the map once before years ago. After making some new textures and reworking a few streets I found the layout quite limiting and it felt better to start something new from scratch and thus SnD was born.

SnD started as a working title (short for "sand" or "search 'n destroy") but it stuck and I never bothered to change it. I really wanted to push the engine this time and make something rather unique to Sven Co-op: an open world map where you could navigate the map at your own pace and insights. 

The most challenging part of the design is the fact that it's the goldsrc engine. Huge outdoor areas doesn't make it happy and large polycounts will grind the performance to a halt even on modern machines. I've taken great care to design the map in perfect 128x128 blocks with plenty of VIS blocks and HINT brushes pretty much everywhere.

It's been a lot of work to get the map done not only because of the size but also because I made nearly everything by myself from stratch. This gave me the freedom however, to create the map exactly as I wanted it to be and that was pretty cool.
