About the map:

You have been sent to a weird magical world for a hard mission. 
You need to collect 10 powerfully magical symbols for a science team. 
These symbols are the heart of this world, and give it it's bright colours and magic.

Each symbol is located in it's own area, protected by monsters and different puzzles. 
In addition to a certain colour, the symbol also represents it's own theme, which is related to the symbols own area, monsters and puzzles.

After finding a symbol, a new door will open randomly. 
This way you will never know which puzzle you need to solve next.

The symbols will appear in the spawn area after they have been picked.
