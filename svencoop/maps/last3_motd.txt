After fighting through the complex, the team stumbled
upon a few of the remaining soldiers. The team
was told that the HQ has decided to pull back all forces
to the Main Base to defend it at all costs from the
alien invasion.

The soldiers have build up a teleporting machine to
warp back to the base, but they are missing a vital 
element before they can use the machine : 

"An Energy Crystal" 

There might be a chance of finding one in the 
storage complex ahead. Ofcourse that isn't going
to be easy.

Objectives :
* Report to the HQ [ Completed ]
* Fight your way trough the complex [ Completed ]
* Shut down the Waygates [ Aborted ]
* Find a Energy Crystal for the Teleporter
