The team joined up with the soldiers and stepped 
through the teleporter. The aliens already 
breached the fence and had the chance of building
a waygate next to the base. The remaining
soldiers killed many of the alien builders but
they managed to finish the waygate. The
gate is now activating and almost ready to
teleport alien forces into the Human Base.

Making conditions even worse, the Anarchists
Faction took their benefits of the chaos to 
gather weapons from the base before the aliens 
could destroy them. They have sent an Osprey to
reinforce their forces in the area.

The Human Forces have nowhere to retreat to, and
are facing the hordes of enemies coming right at 
them. Everything now comes down to this last moment,
at New Hope's Last Stand.
