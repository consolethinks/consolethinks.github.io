-----------------------------------

Our planet has recently been infiltrated by aliens and we believe
that a more devastating attack is imminent.

We found out that the source of these creatures is a secret
research facility named Crystal which we lost a contact with a couple
of weeks ago. Presumably the alien surge resulted from a faulty
experiment but that is something we cannot change anymore.

Your team has been assigned the mission to destroy the alien source in
Crystal and put an end to the alien infiltration. Keep in mind that
the facility holds some very advanced technology - be careful and
use it to your advantage if you can.

As you approach your destination you managed to sneak into the lobby of
Crystal via the facility's ventilation system. It's up to you to
finish the job from here on.

Good luck!
