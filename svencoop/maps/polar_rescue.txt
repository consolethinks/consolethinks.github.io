.: Description :.

A global gang of illegal arms dealers have taken a 5 man team of the world’s finest nuclear specialists hostage to a hideout of theirs in Antarctica. Your Sven Co-op team has been selected specially to rescue them. Knowing the captives well they are likely to refuse working with terrorists or similar even under torture, we have learned that the gang will kill them when they find out they have no use for them.

The gang have also constructed several mini nuclear rockets that are currently being stored in the same hideout. Disable any nuclear equipment on the premises to put a stop on further production.

Be sure to pick up any documents. They will tell us what this gang intends on doing in the near future. You will have to get in secured storage areas to find them.

2 elite soldiers have already been dispatched to the area. Hopefully they will be able to reach you and assist you in your mission, though don't hold your breath for their arrival.

An Osprey helicopter will arrive to extract your team and the hostages once all your objectives are completed and the landing platform is clear. Use a radio to call for your extraction once your mission is completed.

Your objectives are:

    1. Rescue all hostages before they are executed
    2. Disarm all nuclear warheads
    3. Collect all secret documents
    4. Clear the landing platform for extraction
    5. Radio for an extraction Osprey once you have all hostages in a safe area (radio room)

Rescuing the 5 hostages is your absolute top priority, and you only have a short time before the gang boss has them executed! Ensure they are safe before attempting any other objectives.

Failure will denote your redundancy to our elite team -- and nobody leaves us, alive.

Alpha 2 (13th July, 2010)

    * Added env_sound entities to apply various effects in cavernous/tunnel/large areas
    * Moved the two mini-turrets away from the corner of the wall so their sounds work

Alpha 3 (15th July, 2010)

    * Added even more HINT/SKIP brushes for better performance
    * Added sound to the nuclear missile explosion
    * Set up env_sound according to Puchi's position/radius recommendations
    * Used HLFix to export a MAP from RMF -- it actually turns out much better
    * Fixed nuclear missile explosion not killing players
    * Fixed nuclear missile warheads having bad brushes

Beta 1 (21st July, 2010)

    * Added some extra detail to the middle floor
    * Fixed 2 scripted guards not always trying to run to their buttons
    * Fixed hostage safety zone
    * Tweaked skill configuration
    * Using final compile configuration

Beta 2 (26th July, 2010)

    * Added some extra detail here and there
    * Fixed lighting in pretty much all areas, apart from the bottom floor storage room
    * Fixed random guard in the bottom floor storage room blocking players in by the teleporter switch
    * Removed some ammo from main corridors to encourage players to search rooms more
    * Tweaked brushwork around the fuel area
    * Tweaked monster nodes
    * Tweaked skill configuration

Beta 3 (29th July, 2010)

    * Compiled map with newer SHLT x64 (3.9), no actual map changes

Release Candidate 1 (6th August, 2010)

    * Added some extra detail here and there, couple more lights to help solve "blackholes"
    * Added some extra guards for when the alarm is activated
    * Increased starting health and armour from 150/100 to 200/200 as the guards are actually very hard
    * Made the blue stacked pipes near the fuel area hollow, they looked stupid with black texture ends

Release Candidate 2 (7th August, 2010)

    * Optimized node layout according to Puchi's advice
    * Put starting armour back to 100, as 200 was just too much

Release Candidate 3 (12th August, 2010)

    * Added a push block forcing the hostages to move slightly in the execution cut scene, to ensure they die
    * Added some extra detail here and there
    * Added some extra guards to the reactor room
    * Added two HEV chargers and some batteries dotted about
    * Inverted the breakthrough tunnel direction in the bottom storage room to fix bad lighting
    * Sort of fixed the 2 scripted guards not doing their thing

Release Candidate 4 (17th August, 2010)

    * Added lasers to the vault, though mainly for decoration
    * Added some extra detail here and there
    * Fixed scientists in the execution cut scene not being in the intended pose (thanks Soctom)
    * Fixed guard action scripts (thanks Sven Viking)
    * Fixed some odd brushwork
    * Made the keycard slot texture a bit better
    * Some new girder textures for the vault

Public Release (22nd August, 2010)

    * Added HUD info to most breakables, so players know they can break them
    * Compiled map with Vluzacn's ZHLT 'VL17' (custom x64 build with special limits)
    * Fixed invisible battery in front of the 2 chargers
    * Fixed invisible sinks in 2 of the jail cells
    * Fixed some odd lighting holes, thanks to Vluzacn's ZHLT modifications
    * Moved the hostages away from the tight clipping area in case they get stuck (rare)

Revised (17th September, 2010)

    * Added more spawn points as a lot of tele-fragging was happening at the start of the map
    * Embedded all my custom textures in the BSP
    * The hostage execution timer is now cut off once the boss is killed, as many players could not find the cell key easily
    * ^ Because of this, the hostage execution timer is down to 15 minutes from 20
    * Tweaked a lot of the map core entities, should save some time and memory

Revised 2 (7th June, 2011)
