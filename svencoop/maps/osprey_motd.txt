OSPREY ATTACK - Arena-type

Objective: Destroy the Osprey Helicopter.

Tips:

» There are explosive crates on the observation deck. 
  Be careful around this area!

» If the grunts are overwhelming you and your teammates,
  push the "WARNING" button under the observation deck.
  It will spawn a Gonarch and should even the playing
  field.

» 4 m203 Grenades are available in the freezer. You will
  need to run quickly in and out though, or you will
  die from the cold.

» There is an UZI in the red crates outside. Find a way
  into the crates to get the weapon.
