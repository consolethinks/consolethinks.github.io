-=STORY=-
	A group of mercenaries have acquired bio-hazardous material
	and took shelter in a small town. Overhead surveillance 
	of the area has confirmed nine targets for demolition. 

	Your mission is to escort the Engineer to all of these targets.
	Your team will need to hold back any incoming forces and 
	give the Engineer cover fire while he plants the explosives.
