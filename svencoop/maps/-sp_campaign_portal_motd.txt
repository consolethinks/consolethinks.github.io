YOU NEED AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE IN ORDER TO CHOOSE A CHAPTER.

Chapters are sub-divided by game: Ground level Opposing Force, first storey Half-Life + Uplink, Outside area Blue Shift.

If an Area is not accessible, either the server admin disabled it, or the Single Player Campaign is not available on the Server.

Each table with two consoles represents a chapter. You need to press both buttons on a table at once WHILE STAYING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CONSOLE.
When you fail to open a Portal, you will hear "Access Denied".

In case an Area or more are sealed, there are two possibilities:
1) The automatic check noticed that the Area(s) are not available. In this case contact the server admin to install the SP conversion (usually OpFor and/or Blue Shift)
2) The server admin used the custom cvars on these SP conversion and only let's you play what is open.
