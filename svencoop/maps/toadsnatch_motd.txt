Toad Snatch

Server owners: For this level, please disable XP Mod and other servermods that radically alter the gameplay. Give the level a chance to be played as it was intended.



Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy stronghold and steal the Chumtoad Deluxe. Once the chumtoad has been picked up you must return it to the Obelisk.

While the heist is taking place you must also protect the Obelisk from being destroyed.

Players who die and respawn become Ghosts. They will be unable to leave the Obelisk area.

Ghosts can only return to the assault when the team reaches a checkpoint, which allows a single Ghost to spawn at the checkpoint by entering a teleport.


Tips: 

- You must wait 20 seconds before you can select a difficulty, so people have time to join.

- If a grapple section is too difficult, try grappling on to another player. 

- The Obelisk can be repaired with the wrench.

- Picking up new weapons will make them available for defenders as well.

- A button in each checkpoint supply room will spawn a friendly sentry turret near the Obelisk.
