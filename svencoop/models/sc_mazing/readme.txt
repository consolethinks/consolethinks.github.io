Model credits:

	New models made by JJ45 for this map:
	- blop.mdl (Heart of the Pyramid, used as a headcrab replacement)
	- zombie.mdl (Servant of Ra, mummy)

	Reskins of default models by A1win:
	- babygarg.mdl (Labyrinth Gargantua)
	- pit_drone.mdl (Labyrinth Hunter)
	- scarab.mdl (Scarab, from w_squeak.mdl, snark)
	
Feel free to use the models in your maps, just remember to give proper
credits for JJ45 if you use blop.mdl or zombie.mdl. The reskins are so
simple that I don't even want any credits for them! ;p
